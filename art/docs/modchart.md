# Tutorial for modcharts of FNF Extra

### Here are the modchart changes that differ from the KE 1.6.2 version

## Scroll speed changes:

`setSpeed(2.8, true);` <- **sets speed to 2.8**, **if true** then **updates watermark**: `Speed: 2.8` (btw its not necessary to write true, since true is written in the function by default)

`addSpeed(0.5, false);` <- **adds 0.5 to speed**, **if false** then **not updates watermark**, *idk why it, but why not?*

> You can anyway change scroll speed via **function beatHit** in **PlayState.hx**, if you dont know Lua language
